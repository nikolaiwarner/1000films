# 1000films

a command line program to find where to watch the 1000 greatest films as ranked by theyshootpictures.com

## How to use

`$ npm i -g 1000films`

`$ 1000films [number]`

## Credits

I have converted the ranking data into a json format for easier parsing but the film ranking data is, I presume, copyright 2020 theyshootpictures.com.

Thanks to justwatch.com for streaming information and, of course, theyshootpictures.com!
